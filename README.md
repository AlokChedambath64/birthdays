<h1>
  Birthdays

In app.py, youâ€™ll find a Flask web application. The application has one route (/) that accepts both POST requests and GET requests. 

birthdays.db is a SQLite database with one table, birthdays, that has four columns: id, name, month, and day.

In the static directory is a styles.css file containing the CSS code for this web application.

In the templates directory is an index.html file that will be rendered when the user views your web application.
